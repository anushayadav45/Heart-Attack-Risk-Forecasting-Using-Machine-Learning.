# Heart-Attack-Risk-Forecasting-Using-Machine-Learning.
This project aims to predict an individual's risk of a heart attack using machine learning techniques. By analyzing medical history, lifestyle factors, and genetic predispositions, the model offers insights to aid in heart attack prevention.

Project Overview:
The project leverages various machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and SVM, to identify individuals at risk of heart attacks. The best-performing model, Random Forest, achieved an accuracy of 85.21%, making it the most effective algorithm for this task.

Tools and Technologies :
1.Programming Language: Python
2.Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
3.GUI: Tkinter for interactive user interface and result display
